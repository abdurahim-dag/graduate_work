Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta''s suspension, its owner/president, José Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, José, upon Philip''s expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, Inês Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and Inês fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and Inês do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, Inês'' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul''s American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/Inês relationship being fraught with life long problems.

A world where three friends are brought together by the same destination. Or maybe, it all comes down to daydreaming. And feeling the empty spaces with music. It all depends on how you choose to see things. In black, in white, or in sync with the beat. Billion Star Hotel, for each viewer, a different story.', null, 6.1, 'movie');

During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford''s acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford''s personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan''s unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford''s films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman''s Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.', null, 2.7, 'movie');

He went on to redefine the science fiction genre and influence the way Hollywood made their science fiction films, including the Academy Award-winning Visual Effects Master, Robert Skotak, a man who spent years trying to track Klushantsev down. This is a film about a fantastic inventor and dreamer whose destiny was intimately linked with the Space Race and the whims of the Soviet dictatorship. However, despite dying blind and penniless, Klushantsev has left an indelible mark on the history of film and inspired countless filmmakers. The Star Dreamer ensures that the name of Pavel Klushantsev lives on.', null, 8.1, 'movie');

While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourist''s camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person''s wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship''s control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country''s ruin, and where Raul''s reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro''s supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer.

The manager called his press agent in, scolded him and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that "they must be extremely funny and extremely cheap." Within a short time the agent returned and proudly announced he had found "an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15." "I dodged all the agencies," he explained, "and down on one of the side streets I ran across an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a regular comedy queen. She didn''t say much, but she certainly was full of ''pep.'' She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow." The manager tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to the "Soap Suds Star," Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. "It''s all your fault," he said bitterly, "You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married, and quit vaudeville for the classics." "I think it a dandy idea," said the agent. "Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the balcony scene" The manager, impressed, retained his "Soap Suds Star," and his leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow. But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him. Then, finding that his clothes had been well sprinkled in the river, she ironed him out, and gave him a life position in the laundry.', null, 5.3, 'movie');
